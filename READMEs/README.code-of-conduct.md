# Libwebsockets Code of Conduct

This CoC is for users, not contributors.  If you do contribute useful stuff, you don't need a CoC since you evidently already get it.

1. The only thing people have in common here is they hope to benefit from using lws.  Otherwise they cross the street to avoid each other, right?  You sure aren't any oil painting.

2. As a user, nobody owes you anything.  You already owe the authors, for working on this code and freely making it available to you, that you are trying to leverage.  Align your complaints, requests and hopes to this reality or get ignored.  As a contributor, depending on what you contributed, the maintainer may end up owing you instead.  But as a user, you are in debt to the people who did the work from the start: align your expectations for asking for more of anyone's time without being generous with your own accordingly.

3. You're trying to make money using this work you freely came by because of the original author's license grant?  You're going to compensate those who did the work on this you are leveraging accordingly?  No?  Then it's only reasonable to expect those who don't directly benefit from solving your issue to NOT TO GIVE A SHIT about whatever your problem, or the problems of your customers, are.  That goes triple for third-party commercial leechers where their game library provider picked a random lws version from years ago and contributed absolutely NOTHING to the upstream project all that time, while banking it and leaving it to me to support their customers.  Yeah you, you assholes.

4. Want to work together or contribute on something useful in lws for you and others?  The maintainer is a consultant and by coincidence quite familiar with lws.
